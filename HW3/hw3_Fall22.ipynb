    "Due __Oct 20, 2022__ by 11:59pm. \n",
    "\n",
    "Please rename this file with __\"LastName_FirstName_hw3\"__ \n",

    "Notes: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Please do not rename this file or delete the exercise cells. Put your answers in new cells after each exercise. You can make as many new cells as you like. Use code cells for code and Markdown cells for text. Answer all questions with complete sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Your code should be readable; writing a piece of code should be compared to writing a page of a book. Adopt the __one-statement-per-line__ rule. Consider splitting a lengthy statement into multiple lines to improve readability. (You will lose one point for each line that does not follow the one-statement-per-line rule)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. To help understand and maintain code, you should always add comments to explain your code. Use the _hash symbol_ (#) for writing a comment (homework without any comments will automatically receive 0 points). Use _docstring_ to explain a function\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Submit your final work with a __.pdf__ or a __.html__ file to Canvas. To convert a .ipynb file to a .pdf/.html file, go to \"File\", click \"Download as\", and then click \"PDF via LaTeX\"/\"HTML\". \n",
    "\n",
    "5. This assignment will be graded for correctness.\n"
